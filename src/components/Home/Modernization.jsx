              The new World Exchange Plazaâ€™s modernization is nothing short of transformative. It ushers 
              in a new spirit destined to resonate with all who gather, work, and visit. Where common and 
              public realm areas have been designed to be places to meet, gather, collaborate or spend a 
              solo moment, peacefully. Where every common area and amenity has been thoughtfully reconsidered 
              and renovated to reflect modern sensibilities. A place that beckons, inspires, and brings 
              a new appreciation for this legendary destination.
